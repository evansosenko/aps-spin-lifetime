    The geometry of the nonlocal spin valve analyzed in this paper is shown.
    There are two ferromagnetic electrodes placed on a conducting channel.
    Current $I$ flows into the left electrode,
    while the potential $V$ is measured at the right electrode.
    The nonlocal resistance is defined as the ratio $V / I$.
    For spin dependent phenomena, the relevant quantity of interest
    is the difference between the nonlocal resistance for the parallel
    and antiparallel orientations of magnetization of the two electrodes.

The assumed device geometry is shown in \cref{fig:nonlocal_spin_valve}.
Two ferromagnetic contacts ($F$) are deposited on the normal semiconductor ($N$).
A spin-polarized current $I$ is injected through the contact at $x = 0$
and flows in the $x ≤ 0$ region of the semiconductor.
The voltage difference $V$ is measured at $x = L$ between the contact and the semiconductor.
The nonlocal resistance is $\rNL = V / I$ \cite{PhysRevB.67.052409}.
The key parameters are
the contact spacing $L$,
the diffusion constant $D$,
the spin lifetime $τ$,
the spin diffusion length $λ = \sqrt{D τ}$,
and $ω = \left( g μ_B / ℏ \right) B$ which is proportional to
the applied magnetic field $B$ and the gyromagnetic ratio $g$.

The nonlocal resistance is found by solving the Bloch diffusion equation.
A detailed derivation is given in \cref{s:appendix}
and reveals $\rNL$ may be written in the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nonlocal_resistance}
  \rNL^± = ± p_1 p_2 R_N f .
\end{equation}
The overall sign corresponds to parallel and antiparallel ferromagnetic alignments.
Specifically, we find a resistance scale
\begin{equation}
  R_N = \frac{λ}{W L} \frac{1}{σ^N} ,
\end{equation}
and the function
\begin{widetext}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:f}
    f = \re{ \left\{ \left(
          2 \left[ \sqrt{1 + i ω τ} + \frac{λ}{2} \left( \frac{1}{r_0} + \frac{1}{r_L} \right) \right]
          e^{\left( L / λ \right) \sqrt{1 + i ω τ}}
          + \frac{λ^2}{r_0 r_L} \frac{
              \sinh{ \left[ \left( L / λ \right) \sqrt{1 + i ω τ} \right] }}
            {\sqrt{1 + i ω τ}}
        \right)^{-1} \right\} } .
  \end{equation}
\end{widetext}
The polarizations $p_1$ and $p_2$, defined in \cref{eq:polarizations},
model the effective current injection.

Note that $f$ is unitless and depends only on the scales $L / λ$, $ω τ$, and $λ / r_i$.
The parameters $r_i$ with $i$ either $0$ for the left contact or $L$ for the right are
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:r-parameter}
  r_i = \frac{R_F + R_C^i}{\rSQ} W ,
\end{equation}
where $R_F$ is the resistance of the ferromagnet
and $R_C^i$ are the individual contact resistances,
$W$ is the graphene flake width, and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:square_resistance}
  \rSQ = W / σ^N ,
\end{equation}
is the graphene square (sheet) resistance
given in terms of the semiconductor conductivity $σ^N$.
The resistances $R_F$ and $R_C^i$ are the effective resistances
of a unit cross sectional area.
They are defined in \cref{eq:contact.resistance,eq:ferromagnet.resistance}.
To obtain an expression in terms of the ohmic resistances,
one must make the substitutions
$R_F → W_F W R_F$ and $R_C^i → W_F W R_C^i$,
where $W_F$ is the contact width, i.e., $W_F W$ is the contact area.
We will use the same symbols for either resistance type when the meaning is clear.
The spin polarization of the semiconductor $P_σ^F$ is defined in \cref{eq:material.polarization},
and the spin polarizations of the individual contacts $P_Σ^i$ are defined in \cref{eq:contact.polarization}.

The expression $Δ \rNL = \abs{\rNL^+ - \rNL^-}$
measures the difference in signal between parallel and antiparallel field alignments.
We combine $P^2 = \abs{p_1 p_2}$
\footnote{
  Assuming the polarizations $P_σ^F$ and $P_Σ^L$ have the same sign bounds $P ≤ 1$.
},
and write
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nonlocal_resistance.difference}
  Δ \rNL = 2 P^2 R_N \abs{f} ,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  R_N = \frac{λ}{W} \frac{1}{σ_G} ,
\end{equation}
where $σ_G = σ^N L$ is the graphene conductance normally given in units of
$\si{\milli \siemens} = \left( \si{\milli \ohm} \right)^{-1}$.
