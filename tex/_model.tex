    The geometry of the nonlocal spin valve analyzed in this paper is shown.
    There are two ferromagnetic electrodes placed on a conducting channel.
    Current $I$ flows into the left electrode,
    while the potential $V$ is measured at the right electrode.
    The nonlocal resistance is defined as the ratio $V / I$.
    For spin dependent phenomena, the relevant quantity of interest
    is the difference between the nonlocal resistance for the parallel
    and antiparallel orientations of magnetization of the two electrodes.

The assumed device geometry is shown in \cref{fig:nonlocal_spin_valve},
and the nonlocal resistance is $\rNL = V / I$ \cite{PhysRevB.67.052409}
(see also \cref{s:appendix:nonlocal_resistance}).
The key parameters are
the contact spacing $L$,
the diffusion constant $D$,
the spin lifetime $τ$,
the spin diffusion length $λ = \sqrt{D τ}$,
and $ω = \left( g μ_B / ℏ \right) B$ which is proportional to the applied magnetic field $B$.
Any symbols not defined in the body of this paper can be found in \cref{s:appendix}.

We find the nonlocal resistance may be written in the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nonlocal_resistance}
  \rNL^± = ± p_1 p_2 R_N f ,
\end{equation}
where $p_1, p_2$ depend on the polarizations, $R_N$ is a resistance scale,
and $f$ is unitless and depends only on the scales $L / λ$, $ω τ$, and $λ / r_i$.
The overall sign has been added in by hand
and corresponds to parallel and antiparallel ferromagnetic alignments.
The parameters $r_i$ with $i$ either $0$ for the left contact or $L$ for the right are
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:r-parameter}
  r_i = \frac{R_F + R_C^i}{\rSQ} W ,
\end{equation}
where $R_F$ is the resistances of the ferromagnet
and $R_C^i$ are the contact resistances
\footnote{
  The resistances $R_F, R_C^i$ are the effective resistances
  of a unit cross sectional area.
  To obtain an expression in terms of the ohmic resistances,
  one must make the substitutions
  $R_F → W_F W R_F$,
  $R_C^i → W_F W R_C^i$,
  where $W_F$ is the contact width, i.e., $W_F W$ is the contact area.
  We will use the same symbols for either resistance type when the meaning is clear.
},
$W$ is the graphene flake width, and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:square_resistance}
  \rSQ = W / σ^N ,
\end{equation}
is the graphene square (sheet) resistance.

A detailed derivation is given in \cref{s:appendix}.
Specifically, we find a resistance
\begin{equation}
  R_N = \frac{λ}{W L} \frac{1}{σ^N} ,
\end{equation}
polarizations given by
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:polarizations}
  \begin{align}
    p_1 & = \frac{P_σ^F R_F + P_Σ^L R_C^L}{R_F + R_C^L} , \\
    p_2 / p_1 & = \left. \left( 1 - \frac{P_σ^F R_F}{P_Σ^L R_C^L} \right) \middle/
                  \left(1 + \frac{P_σ^F R_F}{P_Σ^L R_C^L} \right) \right. ,
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
and the function
\begin{widetext}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:f}
    f = \re{ \left\{ \left(
          2 \left[ \sqrt{1 + i ω τ} + \frac{λ}{2} \left( \frac{1}{r_0} + \frac{1}{r_L} \right) \right]
          e^{\left( L / λ \right) \sqrt{1 + i ω τ}}
          + \frac{λ^2}{r_0 r_L} \frac{
              \sinh{ \left[ \left( L / λ \right) \sqrt{1 + i ω τ} \right] }}
            {\sqrt{1 + i ω τ}}
        \right)^{-1} \right\} } .
  \end{equation}
\end{widetext}

The expression $Δ \rNL = \abs{\rNL^+ - \rNL^-}$
measures the difference in signal between parallel and antiparallel field alignments.
We combine $P^2 = \abs{p_1 p_2}$
\footnote{
  Assuming the polarizations $P_σ^F$ and $P_Σ^L$ have the same sign bounds $P ≤ 1$.
},
and write
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nonlocal_resistance.difference}
  Δ \rNL = 2 P^2 R_N \abs{f} ,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  R_N = \frac{λ}{W} \frac{1}{σ_G} ,
\end{equation}
where $σ_G = σ^N L$ is the graphene conductance normally given in units of
$\si{\milli \siemens} = \left( \si{\milli \ohm} \right)^{-1}$.
