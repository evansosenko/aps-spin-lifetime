  Injection, transmission, and detection of spins in a conducting channel
  are the basic ingredients of spintronic devices.
  Long spin lifetimes during transit are an important ingredient in realizing this technology.
  An attractive platform for this purpose is graphene, which has high mobilities
  and low spin-orbit coupling.
  Unfortunately, measured spin lifetimes are orders of magnitude smaller
  than theoretically expected.
  A source of spin loss is the resistance mismatch between
  the ferromagnetic electrodes and graphene.
  While this has been studied numerically,
  here we provide a closed form expression for Hanle spin precession
  which is the standard method of measuring spin lifetimes.
  This allows for a detailed characterization of the nonlocal spin valve device.
