\label{s:fits}

Data presented in fig. 4 from \cite{PhysRevLett.105.167202}
was fit

to the model presented here.
The resistance of the ferromagnet \ce{Co} is computed as
$R_F = ρ_F λ_F / A_J$,
where $A_J$ is the junction area estimated at $A_J = W d$,
with $d$ between \SIrange[range-phrase={ and }]{0.5}{50}{\nano \meter}
\cite{PhysRevLett.105.167202}.

\Cref{fig:nonlocal_resistance.difference}
shows that the overall effect of including a finite $R_C$ is to increase $τ$.
Fits (a) and (b) with tunneling contacts give large
$R_C ∼ \SI{10e7}{\kilo \ohm}$ and comparable lifetimes,
while (d) with transparent contacts gives a reduced $R_C ∼ \SI{3}{\kilo \ohm}$
and a lifetime increased by a factor of two.
